              The Enterprise DevOps Team was chartered to create a new system for deploying and maintaining the infrastructure for Blackbaud CRM &mdash; an Enterprise-scale CRM product &mdash; which was previously deployed via a legacy custom application.

              On this team, I focus on combining open source tools such as Ansible with custom PowerShell scripts needed for our application and existing environments. 

              As the team lead for the Enterprise Platform Team I focused on the foundational platform for Blackbaud CRM product. I was the front line for my team when dealing with thorny production issues that ranged from helping our hosting services team diagnose environmental problems to providing developer support for customer-written customizations on top of our platform.

              In this role, I worked closely with our product support and product management 
              teams to ensure that I was always providing a customer-focused solution whether I was fixing bugs across multiple product versions or recommending configuration changes to 
              internal customer environments.

              Today, I leverage my deep experience with our technology to provide guidance to other teams building new product features on the Infinity platform, help architect and guide new platform feature development, and perform code reviews for both my team and others.

              And I've done all this without breaking compatibility for a large swathe of customizations written by both our clients and our internal professional services team.

          My hobbies and side projects are great ways to explore new technologies and techniques that aren't always directly applicable at work.

          From playing with interesting CoreAnimation methods in iOS to experimenting with non-relational cloud-based data stores, I'm never bored at home. 

          By taking a broad survey of the current practices in the industry during my off-hours, I'm able to recognize new opportunities and possibilities when 
          on the clock.
