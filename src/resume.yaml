              My current team was chartered to create a new system for deploying and maintaining the infrastructure for all of our next-gen products and capabilities.

              On this team, I focus on combining Azure's PaaS building blocks with our own internal automation to allow service teams to quickly and easily deploy new microservices to production with all of the obvious NFRs around availability, monitoring, security, and compliance.

              Recently, I've assisted in architecting a change in our service-hosting platform from Azure App Service web apps to a Kubernetes platform based on AKS.

              With our highly-standardized implementations, my small team is able to provide on-call support for all infrastructure issues any of our services encounter. During these incidents, I jump from technical troubleshooting and repair activities, coordination between various internal groups, and liaising with Azure support personnel.

              Previously, as the team lead for the Enterprise Platform Team I focused on the foundational platform for Blackbaud's Enterprise CRM product. I was the front line for my team when dealing with thorny production issues that ranged from helping our hosting services team diagnose environmental problems to providing developer support for customer-written customizations on top of our platform.

              In this role, I worked closely with our product support and product management teams to ensure that I was always providing a customer-focused solution whether I was fixing bugs across multiple product versions or recommending configuration changes to internal customer environments.

           A series of personal websites hosted as a set of Docker containers on a major cloud provider; both the infrastructure and sites are deployed and maintained via a custom CLI tool
           
           A website for organizing a book club &mdash; built on Ruby and Sinatra using Amazon Web Services and Redis for data storage
           
           Mac and iOS apps for generating secure, memorable passwords &mdash; built in Objective-C and Swift
           
           A "branded" website for displaying photos and albums from a 3rd-party photo hosting service &mdash; built in PHP with the SmugMug API for data storage
           
           This resume is a YAML file that is rendered client-side by a custom TypeScript app; the site is hosted as an aforementioned Docker container

          My hobbies and side projects are great ways to explore new technologies and techniques that aren't always directly applicable at work.

          From playing with interesting CoreAnimation methods in iOS to experimenting with non-relational cloud-based data stores, I'm never bored at home. 

          By taking a broad survey of the current practices in the industry during my off-hours, I'm able to recognize new opportunities and possibilities when 
          on the clock.
